1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?

*to load JSX*

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?

*a JS object*

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```

*component 'page' contains 2 elems, JSX can take only 1*

4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?

*declarative means commands tell just what to do, imperative means they tell what to do and which way*

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?

*it means that you can construct smth from different components using it*
